Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of
coins needed to meet a given amount total.

Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
If total is 0 or less, return 0
If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
You can assume you have an infinite number of each
denomination of coin in the list

Your solution’s runtime will be evaluated in this task
